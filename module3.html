        - style of id is more super than the style of class

        Adding internal css
    p{
        background-color : white
    }

    Here 'p' is selector and content inside the brackets is declaration.
    'background-color' is the property and 'white' is the value


    - em

     'em' is a typographic term that has come to the Web. On the Web, em units are usually used for vertical dimensions.  
      One 'em' maps to the height of one capital letter in the parent context.   

      li { font-size: 0.9em; }  /* text in a list item is smaller than its parents */
      h1 { font-size: 1.2em; }  /* but an h1 will be bigger than the parent */
      i  { font-size: 0.5em; }  /* and any italicized text will be half as big. */


    - vh / vw
      
        'vh' stands for viewport height, and 'vw' for viewport width.  The vh and vw units 
        work much like the percentage ( % ) unit. But instead of percentage of the parent, 
        it is percentage of the screen (aka viewport).  Obviously, vh is for vertical dimensions, 
        and vw for horizontal dimensions.

        p { 
            margin-left:  10vw;
            margin-right: 10vw;  /* 10% of screen width will be spent on the two side margins */
         }


    
    -Styling Lists
        
        'list-style-type' governs the little list marker that is usually positioned to the left of any list item. 
         For <ul> several popular values: disc, circle, square, and none.
        
        For ordered lists (<ol>)  different ways of having the numbers : decimal, decimal-leading-zero, lower-roman, 
        upper-roman, lower-alpha, upper-alpha, as well as several of the worlds languages: armenian, georgian, 
        simp-chinese-formal, and many others. 

        - list-style-position
         The two values are inside and outside.  They govern whether the markers are positioned inside the box of the list, or outside. 

        -To add image to the bullet points
         li { list-style-image: url("my_triangle.png"); }

    
    -Selectors
        
        - Tags : p{} , h1{}
        - id : #id1 , #id2
        - class : .class1, .class2

        combinig slectors: 
           tag,
           #id, 
           .class{ declaration }
        
        -Specialised selectors
            blockquote.speech { font-color: green; }

            In the example above, the blockquote.speech selector is a blockquote tag selector combined with 
            a .speech class selector.  So this rule will not necessarily apply to every blockquote, nor every element 
            with the speech class. Instead, it will only apply to those blockquotes that also have the speech class.


        - Descendant selectors

           To add a particular style to a tag in a certain section : #sectionID tag { declaration }

           #intro blockquote a { font-weight: bold; } 
           Any <a> tags anywhere inside a <blockquote> anywhere inside the #intro section will now be bold.

        -Direct Descendent selectors

            #inctro > a { declaration }
            The above can be used to apply styles just to the direct descendents.

        -Everything selector

            body > * { margin-left: 10px; } /* all the _direct_ children of the body receive the margin */

        rules defined in class are superior than defined in id.

        add !important after the rule to make it permanent

        - For : <li class="leaf fruit"><a>apple</a></li>
                Selector will be  ' .leaf.fruit '
