        TAGS

        -  Tags are used to define content in HTML. Some examples of tags are <p> , <h1>, <html>, <style>. they have attributes in then.
           Some tags are self closing tags like <br> <hr>
     


        Attributes

            Attributres define and modify the HTML tags. Tags and Attributes collectively make the HTML language

            - GLobal Attributes
            Global Attributes can be applied to all tags. They are common attributes. Like : id, class, style, lang

            - Non Global Attributes
            Non Global Attributes are appliced to specific attributes. Like : reversed, start, scr, alt.
            
    

        Content sepration and styling

            - Italics : <em> is used instead <i> as the first tag empasies the text and when it read by the machine it empahsises on the
                text but with <i> only text is styled.
                    
            - Bold : <strong> is used instead of <b>

            - <blockquote> should be used to wrap text in a quote.    

            Tags other than <em>,  <strong>,  <b>, <i> as said to be semantic as they define content in some way.
            
                ********
                Tags such as <article>, <section>, <header>, <nav> and <footer> were specifically introduced in HTML5
                ********
        
    
        Semantic elements
        
            <header> is simply an area to add an introduction to your webpage
            <article> is a stanf alone element and it can be used to reference particular article or to scrool down to a
                particular article.Rg below
            <section> The section element is used to section a page. For example, chapters in a book, sections in a thesis or 
                splitting an 'about me' page into introduction, interests and skills. 
            
            <div> element should only be used of you cannot use any other element.
            <span> element is used if we want to style something inside the line. And should be your last option.
                <abbr> <code> <cite> can be used instead when possible
       
       
        <img>
            
            alt="" section in image tag should only be filled if the image had some meaining. if the image is just for 
            decoration purposes then leave it empty.

            tittle="" section is used to show text when cursor is rested on the image.

            height and width of the image should only be modified using teh heiht and width attributes
       
       
        Hyperlinks
            
            <a> element is called anchor element.

            Hyperlinks are links in the text which lead to another page when cliked.
            <a></a> tags are used for hyperlinks. And you can add images or text to the links.you can add mail feature too.
            you can id element to the <a> tag and refere to particular article or section on the page.
            
            target="_blank"/"_self" : can be used to open link in new or same page.

            The "media" attribute was introduced in HTML5. We will look at it briefly here. 
            It is used to specify what kind of media or device the URL you linked to in href is 
            optimized for. The URL could be targeted for special devices like projectors, speech synthesizers
            or pages meant to be printed. It is useful if you want to cater your target document that the URL
             points to a particular device type

             media tag can be used to show different image for desktop version and different image for mobile 
             version  to have the best version of the website.

            The "download" attribute is also new in HTML5 and it makes a link download a file instead of navigate 
            to another location. It takes in the filename as value but the value is optional.

        
        Detail and Summanry : 
            
            The details element includes <summary> element which expands to show full text
